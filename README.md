CD-DB-GUI-Application
=====================
Overall reason for this code:
Java based application to keep track of my CD collection and to show people my coding skills. 

NOTES
=====
This code was written using Java 6 with Eclipse Kepler release 2.  
The sql to create the MySQL database is in the Database directory.

NOTES on dbConnectionInfo.txt
======================================
This file contains the information you will need in order to connect to the database.  Anything with <> around it means you have to fill in the proper information. One string on each line. If you change the name of the file or location of the file (which you might wnat to do) you will need to change the code in DBWrapper.java to find it.
